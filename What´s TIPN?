Tipn is a Farcaster mini app designed to integrate tipping directly into the social experience, allowing users to send micro-payments with every "like" or interaction on the platform. Hosted at tipnearn.com, Tipn’s tagline, “Tip with every like. Only on Farcaster,” encapsulates its mission to make rewarding creators effortless and instantaneous. By leveraging Farcaster’s decentralized infrastructure, Tipn enables users to fund their wallets and tip creators for quality content, fostering a culture of appreciation and financial support within the community.

Unlike traditional social media platforms where likes are purely symbolic, Tipn transforms engagement into tangible rewards. This micro-tipping model aligns with Farcaster’s ethos of user empowerment, allowing creators to monetize their content directly without relying on centralized ad-driven models.
