To use Tipn, users must first join Farcaster by creating an account via the official client, such as Warpcast. Once registered, they can access Tipn through the Farcaster interface, set up a wallet, and start tipping. Tutorials and guides, like those found on docs.farcaster.xyz, provide step-by-step instructions for integrating mini apps and managing wallet-based interactions. For those interested in $TIPN specifically, a YouTube tutorial in Indonesian explains how to earn $TIPN allocations on Farcaster, broadening its accessibility.
